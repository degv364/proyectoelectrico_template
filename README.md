This is me trying to use ORG mode instead of LaTeX

You will need an Emacs with org-mode, org-bulllets and org-ref isntalled.

Paste what you find in custom_class.el in you init emacs file. Or you can just load it, it will have the
same result.

Right now I am not able to pass from org to pdf directly, there are some problems with the citations.
So I recomend to export the org to latex and then coompile using the makefile.

There are some LaTeX that appear in the final pdf, I also want to remove them.
