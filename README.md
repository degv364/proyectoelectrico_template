This is me trying to use ORG mode instead of LaTeX

You will need an Emacs with org-mode, org-bulllets and org-ref isntalled.

Paste what you find in custom_class.el in you init emacs file. Or you can just load it, it will have the
same result.

To create the pdf, open example.org with emacs press c-c c-e to open the export menu. And select to export to pdf.
